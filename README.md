# Neighborhood Map Project

This project is the **final project** for the **JavaScript Design Patterns** course, completed as part of the subject at ÄŒVUT FEL.

## Project Overview

As part of my learning journey, I completed three Udacity courses focused on JavaScript:

## Skills Demonstrated

- Using **design patterns** for clean and maintainable code,
- Implementing **Knockout.js** for MVVM architecture,
- Integrating the **Google Maps API** and **external data sources** to enhance user experience.

## Purpose

The project helps to build practical experience in:
- Working with real-world **APIs**,
- Applying **frameworks** to speed up development,
- Creating a professional **front-end web application**.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
